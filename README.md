1- Load testing with ApacheBench on an HTTP webserver (Nginx)
we execute the following command: 
```
ab http://127.0.0.1/ 
```

This basic command isn’t particularly useful without any additional options, so let’s include some. Apache Bench has a lot of options available, but some of the most useful are:

    -n (number): used to specify the number of requests ab should send to apache 
    -k : Use HTTP KeepAlive feature
    -c (concurrent): used to specify the number of simultaneous requests for ab to make
After executing the following command, using the three flags, with which we are hitting the website with 350 simultaneous connections until 20 thousand requests are met. It will be done using the keep alive header:
```
ab -k -c 350 -n 20000 http://127.0.0.1/
```

We got the following result:

we got 0 failed request with a speed of 0.023 ms/request, it returned requests at a rate of 44056.65 requests per second and the slowest request took only 37ms. By incresing the Concurrency Level to 500 we still got the same results, starting from 1000 concurrent request we start having failed requests but with no big difference in time per requests, the 50% of requests was served in 16 ms at a rate of 34823.43 requests/sec:
```

using more than 1020 in concurrency level the ab reaches the maximum files than can be open, and we got the following message:

2- Implementation of ab in Go (goab) including the -n, -c and -k parameters:
it is the folder under the name: ab-Golang
using the same parameters used with ab, we got the following results:
```
$ go run ApacheBench.go -c 350 -n 20000 -k  http://127.0.0.1/
```
```
Benchmarking 127.0.0.1 (be patient).....done

We got 0 failed request like before but with a speed of 0.195 ms/request, it returned requests at a lower rate of 5126.93 requests per second. The fastest request took 1 ms meanwhile the slowest took only 201ms which is much higher than when we used ab. By incresing the Concurrency Level to 500 we still got the same results. Unlike the ab results, starting from 1000 concurrent request until reaching the maximum of files we can have open which is at 1020 concurrent level we got 0 failed requests, the 50% of requests was served in 48 ms at a rate of 5356.95 requests/sec:

3- Implementation of an HTTP server in Go (httpserver) and Comparasion of results:
the program is under the name : httpServer
Load testing our Go http server using the following parameters:
```
ab -c 1010 -n 20000 -k  http://localhost:8080/world
```
we got the following results:

We got 0 failed request with a speed of 0.028 ms/request, it returned requests at a lower rate of 36356.30 requests per second and the slowest request took 124ms. By incresing the Concurrency Level to 1020 or more the server fails and we got a timeout error message:
